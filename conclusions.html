<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<P>
<DD>Median filters are very powerful and useful. In the real world, impulsive noise exists all around us. From your car's alternator, to natural occurences like lightning. Many systems dislike impulsive noise, because it can completely skew information to the point where it is unrecognizable and useless. Many techniques are used in order to avoid having systems corrupted by impulsive noise. But at times impulsive noise can corrupt your system, and you need a way to remove it. Just remember your mother vacuuming the room while you were trying to watch your favorite TV show. Or the janitor arch-welding his mop in the wiring closet. 
<DD>Noise in images is rather subjective to the viewer. I might say that the image is perfectly clear, when someone else might say that there is some noise in the image. Either way, we can both figure out what the picture is. The human mind has the uncanny knack of interpolating around the noise, assuming it's just a little noise. If it's alot of noise, like my <A HREF="mornoisebear.gif">opening image</A>, then filtering techniques will be needed. But with data, as in <A HREF="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~tran">Tai Tran's</A> senior design, the computer will have a tough time figuring out what the data might be. Even if only a few data points are corrupted, the computer doesn't have the "uncanny knack" to deal with the noise.

<DD>My <A HREF="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~tassone/seniordesign/twodmedfilt.c">2 dimensional median filter C program</A> was a very fun and exciting project to accomplish. Professor Dietz and I set out certain objectives at the beginnnig of the semester, and I was able to accomplish about 90% of them.
<DD>Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement into my program the aspects of the Standard Type-M (STM) Median Filter that Professor Dietz's Ph.D. thesis investigates. I had also set out to have my C program import the image as a CompuServe GIF file, but time constraints prohibited that also.
<P>
<DD>In any case, I accomplished the heart of the project. And that was to make a fast and accurate median filter.

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<DD>The most challenging area of the project was the programming. EE's at Bucknell need more C programming experience. I feel all EE's need at least a year of programming experience. I was lucky because I had a year of PASCAL when I was a freshman at Syracuse University. I knew the basic structure of a higher level programming language, and some common pitfalls to look out for. Nevertheless, I spent many days reading C/C++ programming books in order to learn the syntax, and refresh my memory (being that it had been almost three years since the last time I REALLY programmed). It was an invaluable learning experience, and I hope to broaden my knowledge of programming in general. Though, my program isn't Object (or Class) Oriented, I feel that I did a reasonable job considering the circumstances. 
<P>
<DD>I hope that one day I can work for a large firm that is involved with signals and communications. Digital Image Processing is just a derivative of Digital Signal Processing, and it would be nice to work within either field.
<DD>Actually, I am fascinated with special effects. I'd love to work for a company like <A HREF="http://www.lucasarts.com">LucasArts Entertainment Company</A>. Actually, I'd liked to own the company. Yes, I'm dreaming, but one day I'd like to be on the top of a very successful company like LucasArts. I know that LucasArts does some special effects with animatronics, so do some Bucknell Engineers, check out <A HREF="http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~beast95">The BEAST Homepage</A>.
