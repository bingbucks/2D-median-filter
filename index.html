<H1>What can you use a 2 Dimensional median filter for?</H1>

<H1>You can use a 2 dimensional median filter to remove <I>impulsive</I> noise from images, like this one shown here.</H1>

<UL>
	<LI>This image is barely recognizable with impulsive noise corruption. 
Only a non-linear filter, such as a median filter, could remove this noise completely. 
A linear filter would fail to remove the corrupt points without altering the image in an unacceptable manner. 
	<LI>The problem with a median filter, as with any image processing algorithms, is that there is a danger of inefficiencies and lack of speed because of the number of operations that must be performed. 
My algorithm uses a method suggested by Professor Dietz referred to as a Sliding Window Median Filter <I>with</I> linked lists. 
I highlight linked lists because they are the key to the algorithm, and the reason why my algorithm can beat <A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks Matlab</A> algorithm upto several times less. 
And later on, I will explain what linked lists are and how they are more efficient.
	<LI>The goal for this design was <I>SPEED</I>, and of course, accuracy, both of which I accomplished. 
Though due to time constraints, I was not able to accomplish implementing the heart of Professor Dietz's thesis and that was a STM (Standard Type-M) Median Filter. 
And I'll go into a little detail about this.
	<LI>But first, I want to go into some basic background about medians and Digital Image Processing. 
I will begin with a simple 1 Dimensional example, and then I'll migrate over into the 2 Dimensional world.
