<ul>
    <li>A median is the middle term in a sorted list </li>
    <li>Say that you have a group of data: <ul>
            <li>2, 3, 7, 4, 6, 13, 0 </li>
            <li>If we arrange these numbers in numerical order,
                we get: <ul>
                    <li>0, 2, 3, <b>4</b>, 6, 7, 13 and <b>4</b>
                        is the median of the list </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Another Example </li>
            <li>2, 45, 2, 1864, 78 </li>
            <li>Again, arrange these in order, we get: <ul>
                    <li>2, 2, <b>45</b>, 78, 1864 and <b>45</b>
                        is the median </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now we all remember from high school mathematics the
        differences between medians, means, and modes? <ul>
            <li>The mean is the all familiar average: <ul>
                    <li>(2+3+7+4+6+13+0)/7 </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The mode is the most common occurrence: <ul>
                    <li><b>2</b>, 45, <b>2</b>, 1864, 78 and <b>2</b>
                        is the mode </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">What are the significances of the mean,
median, and mode? </h1>

<p>Well, I'd like to use 3 examples that Professor Dietz told me.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mean - To whom would the mean be most important? <ul>
            <li>The mean would be important to, say, <a
                href="http://www.dominos.wati.com">Domino's Pizza</a>.
                Let's say that Domino's is deciding to open a
                business in a particular town. Would they want to
                know the mean, median, or mode of the number of
                pizzas ordered by residents in the area? Well, if
                there weren't lots of people who ate pizza, but
                there were a few sports organizations that
                ordered pizzas by the hundreds, the median would
                be useless, most likely a small number, or zero.
                Here, Domino's would wanted to know the mean
                numbers of pizzas ordered to decide the
                feasibility of franchising here. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mode - To whom would the mode be most important? <ul>
            <li>The mode would be most important to, say, Foot
                Locker (Sorry no URL). Let's say that they decide
                to move into town. Which of the three (mean,
                median, mode) would they want to know? Well, you
                should almost immediately rule out the mean. How
                many pairs of shoes do you know that are size
                9.23. Foot Locker would what to know the mode, or
                the most common shoe size. And the probably want
                to know the second mode, and so on. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Median - To whom would the median be most important? <ul>
            <li>The median would be important to, say, a Census
                Bureau. Let's say that we have a town of 10
                people, and they each make roughly $30,000 a
                year. Now what if <a
                href="http://www.trumptaj.com">Donald Trump</a>
                moves into this town. Would the <i>mean</i>
                income be a good approximation of the annual
                salaries? Not with Donald Trump in town. Here,
                the median salary would be a better representaion
                of the annual income of the town. The median
                tends to reject the extremes, or <b>IMPULSES</b>,
                and that's exact what a median filter does. </li>
        </ul>
